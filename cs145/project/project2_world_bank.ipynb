Programmers are human after all - the more complexity, the more bugs!). Combining these attributes with the operations above should give you a place to start your comparison.\n",

        "  * Scan: When you need to lookup rows by some criteria (eg, people taller than 6 feet). Height is not a key, so the database has to scan all the rows. You can conceptualize this as O(N). Scanning also happens when writing a property to many rows at once.\n",
        "  * Join: When you join tables together, it creates a Cartesian Product of sets (also called pairs). If there are N rows in a table, and another table has roughly the same number of rows (so N there too), then you can think of a two-table join as O(N^2).\n"

Plot \"money spent on healthcare\" versus \"life expectancy\" (play with Gapminder to find the right metrics; there are a few options).

Please also include some way of seeing which country is which (a tooltip, perhaps)."
